# Semantic-Similarity
This Python script builds semantic descriptors from text files and evaluates the semantic similarity between words using cosine similarity. It includes functions to preprocess text, construct word context vectors, and compare words for similarity. Additionally, it allows testing word association accuracy against a test dataset.
